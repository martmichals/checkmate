# Checkmate

## Overview

This project was created to learn more about A.I. It consists of a frontend who's 
source is in the `checkmate/frontend` folder, as well as a backend, who's source is
in the `checkmate/backend` folder.

## Frontend

The frontend was implimented with React (`Node.js` required).
Start up the frontend with the following command in `checkmate/frontend`: <br>

```bash
npm start
```

As of right now, the "A.I." merely plays random moves. You can inspect move logic
on the frontend in this [file](frontend/src/common/chessgame/ChessGame.js). You 
can work on the actual React component that make up the U.I in this 
[folder](frontend/src/components/).

## Backend

In progress.
